                Skills
            </h3>

            <p>The skills I have acquired so far, range far and wide since I keep myself busy with a variety of things.
                So to summarize my skills a bit easier il list them under categories. Which are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Coding</li>
                <li>Managing</li>
                <li>Hardware and Sound</li>
                <li>Producing</li>
                <li>?</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="introduction-skills-coding">
                <h2>Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    Since there is more then one aspect when it comes to coding. I have decided to group everything
                    under
                    sub-category's. Each sub-category then goes into detail about the languages or frameworks mentioned
                    and my experience with them.
                </p>

                <p>List of languages</p>
                <p><i>Ranging from most competent with to least</i></p><br>
                <p>
                    With languages I mean purely the programming language itself. Not some framework or something
                    different from writing the code in a pure way.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PHP</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>C#</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Non language</p>
                <p>
                    Coding languages that don't really count as a language but are still area's where knowledge
                    and or experience matter.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>Scss</li>
                    <li>?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Frameworks</p>
                <p>
                    Coding frameworks which I have previously worked with and so have experience working with.
                </p>

            <div class="introduction-skills-managing">
                <h3>Managing</h3>
                <p>
                    For now there isn't really allot to say about my management skills since there is no real
                    public display for them. Although I love to host events and or manage small projects. These
                    displays of management have all been within private spaces with no direct link or reference to them.

                </p>
                <h4>What now?</h4>
                <p>
                    As for my current situation. I am currently managing my own project group called
                    <strong><a href="projectdg.nl">project dg</a></strong>. Within this group there are a couple of
                    projects running. These projects will be available to the public and are probably displayed all
                    across this website right now.
                </p>

            <div class="introduction-skills-hardware-sound">
                <h3>hardware & Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    For this skill related tab il go into detail about my experience with hardware and sound related
                    skills such as: repairment of hardware, music production, fabrication of hardware (in combination
                    with self-made software), computer construction and video and sound editing.
                </p>

                <h4>Hardware</h4>
                <p>
                    I have interacted and tried to manipulate hardware my entire life. I started to craft self-made
                    machines in earlier parts of my life. But as I started to do this less as became more entranced with
                    software and creating software. Although I did stop manipulation and tangeling with hardware for a
                    while. I am not trying to get back into it by doing a couple of projects under my collective
                    <a href="projectdg.nl">project dg</a>. Here I have a couple of repositories setup with projects
                    linked to them where I try to make something from nothing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for other hardware related things. All I really have to show for it is an old school projects
                    where I read the temperature with the help of a thermostate that was linked to a arduino. This temperature
                    was then taken from the arduino bord and displayed in a graph. For the things displayed in the graph
                    are listed in ....
                </p>


                <h4>Sound</h4>
                <p>
                    Here I will list all my experiences and skills related to sound, sound manipulation, creation and
                    distortion.
                </p>

                <h5>Music</h5>
                <p>
                    For music, il keep it rather short since this topic will reaccure in the hobby's section.
                    I can play 2 instruments: Piano and guitar. I can make music on programs like FL studio and
                    Garage band. And i can -....?

                                Il answer a couple of quick questions first.<br>
                                <b>Who am I?</b><br> my name is maoro salfa flores.<br><br>
                                <b>What do I do?</b><br> I'm a 17 year old programmer. I make music, do
                                a podcast, play guitar and piano, read philosophy and write short
                                stories.<br><br>
                                <b>Why do I do the things I do?</b><br>
                                Because I'm passionate about the things that interest me. There is
                                a reason for everything that I do. But if I had to answer the
                                question <i>why do I do the things I do</i> in general then it
                                would be to improve myself and become a better version of myself
                                then that I was before is started.
