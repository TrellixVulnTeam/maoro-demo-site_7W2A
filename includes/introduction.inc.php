                    Welcome to my website. There are a couple of things you can discover here.
                    There are multiple sides to the website. You can navigate threw it by clicking on
                    a folder on the lefthand side.
                    <br><br>
                    First off would be the
                    <a href="index.php?page=about_me" class="text-red">About_me</a> page.
                    This page will tell you all about me. What I like to do and why I do the things I do.
                    <br><br>
                    The second page <a href="index.php?page=portfolio" class="text-red">Portfolio</a> is were I document all the work i've done that
                    I'm proud enough off to display publicly.
                    <br><br>
                    The third and last page will be the
                    <a href="index.php?page=activity" class="text-red">acitivity page.</a>
                    Which is more of log of my most recent work, git repository and links to other
                    projects.
